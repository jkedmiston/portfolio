  This demos a Google sheet integrations showing download, analysis, upload, and production of a Google slide deck of basic plots from the data set, facilitated by the <a href="https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#" target="_blank">Pygsheets</a> library. If you would like to chuck some data at it, try your own, or if you don't have something at the ready, you can use data I uploaded <a class="btn btn-info btn-xs" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/176y4bgAavZPHAuaQ4MR7RFDxdZEBztU7uKBAFiPPYWA/edit#gid=0">here</a>. Please copy it over to something under your control (suggest File...Make a Copy) and try out the instructions below!

    <li>Give this app permission to edit the sheet, the email to use is {{service_email}}</li>
    <li>In the form below, enter in the URL for your sheet, and the name of the tab where your data resides, and your email (which must be a G-suite email) </li>
