  This demos a Google Pub/Sub integration - a camera (Intel RealSense depth camera) is connected to a computer running the container (defined by docker-compose-intel.yml in this repository). The camera is pointing at a random location in my office. The demo takes about 10 seconds to complete, so please be patient! <br>
